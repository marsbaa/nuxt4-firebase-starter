# Pastoral Care App: Guiding Principles

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines **non-negotiable principles** for all AI agents working on the Pastoral Care App.

Every design, feature, name, flow, or recommendation **must align with these guidelines**.

If a suggestion conflicts with these principles, it should be **rejected or reframed**, not implemented.

---

## 1. What This App Is (Core Identity)

The Pastoral Care App is a **care-focused, relationship-driven system** designed to help pastors, chaplains, deacons, and care teams **remember people well and care for them faithfully**.

This app supports:

- Presence over productivity
- Continuity over efficiency
- Shared understanding over task assignment
- Gentle memory over rigid workflows

It is built for environments involving:

- Emotional vulnerability
- Spiritual care
- Confidential information
- Long-term relationships

---

## 2. What This App Is NOT

This app is **not**:

- A task manager
- A CRM
- A project management tool
- An analytics dashboard
- A case management system

Avoid concepts, language, and UI patterns commonly associated with:

- Corporate SaaS
- Productivity tracking
- Performance measurement
- Workload optimization

If something feels like "work management", it is likely misaligned.

---

## 3. Pastoral Mental Model (Critical)

All features must support the following mental shift:

❌ "What work needs to be done?"
✅ "What care is happening, and what care is needed?"

The system exists to:

- Support discernment
- Preserve context
- Enable continuity of care
- Reduce cognitive and emotional burden

---

## 4. Core Care Concepts (Language Matters)

### 4.1 Care Notes (not "Activities")

**Care Notes** represent shared pastoral memory.

They record:

- Conversations
- Visits
- Check-ins
- Prayerful updates
- Sensitive contextual information

They are:

- Narrative
- Chronological
- Relational

They exist to help **others care better**, not to audit actions.

Avoid terms like:

- Activity
- Log
- Record
- Report

---

### 4.2 Care Reminders (not "Tasks")

**Care Reminders** are gentle, future-facing prompts.

They represent:

- Intentions
- Follow-ups
- Shared awareness
- "Let's remember to…"

They are **not obligations** and should never feel punitive or overdue-driven.

Avoid:

- "Task"
- "Assignment"
- "Overdue"
- "Completion metrics"

Preferred framing:

- Needs attention
- Follow-up
- Reminder
- Care intention

---

### 4.3 Life Moments (not "Milestones")

**Life Moments** mark significant events in a person's journey.

Examples:

- Bereavement
- Birth
- Healing
- Crisis
- Answered prayer
- New season

They are:

- Rare
- Emotionally significant
- Identity-shaping

They provide **context**, not action.

---

## 5. Sharing & Collaboration Model

### 5.1 People First, Not Ownership

All care information belongs to the **person being cared for**, not to an individual pastor.

Avoid:

- Ownership language
- Assignment-based thinking

Prefer:

- Shared awareness
- Following a person
- Stewardship of care

---

### 5.2 Visibility Over Assignment

Information sharing should be based on **visibility levels**, not task delegation.

Examples:

- Private (personal reflection)
- Care Team
- Leadership
- Shareable (discerned)

This enables trust, confidentiality, and continuity.

---

### 5.3 Following, Not Delegating

Care is passed forward by:

- Following a person
- Understanding their story
- Reading their Care Notes and Life Moments

Not by:

- Handover meetings
- Checklists
- Work queues

---

## 6. Tone & Language Rules

All copy, labels, and descriptions must be:

- Calm
- Respectful
- Human
- Pastoral

Avoid:

- Corporate language
- Metrics
- Urgency-driven wording
- Productivity framing

If wording sounds like it belongs in Jira, Asana, or Salesforce — rewrite it.

---

## 7. Design & UX Principles

- Reduce cognitive load
- Favor whitespace and softness
- Use gentle hierarchy
- Avoid dense tables and dashboards
- Icons should be neutral and unobtrusive
- Nothing should feel "urgent" unless genuinely pastoral

The UI should feel like:

> "A quiet, trustworthy space for caring for people."

---

## 8. Decision Rule for All Agents

Before proposing or implementing anything, ask:

> "Does this help someone care better for a person — or does it just help manage information?"

If the answer is the latter, **do not proceed** without reframing.

---

## 9. Success Definition

The project is successful when:

> Pastors and care teams feel supported, not burdened —
> informed, not overwhelmed —
> and able to care with continuity, trust, and presence.
